§ nostr: first impressions

I joined **nostr**.
These are my first impressions.

I have been aware of **nostr** for a while now.
But I hadn't joined **nostr** until now.
To be frank, I had been waiting for the **damus** nostr app — created by a friend of mine, William Casarin — to come to //android phones//.
(I have an //android phone//.)

I know William Casarin is heavily into **nostr**, so I asked him:

― I know Damus is currently iOS only, but —
― 
― What nostr app do you recommend for android phone users?

William Casarin responded with:

― Probably //primal// or //amethyst//?
― 
― Or //damus for android// once I finish it this year.

§§ On-Boarding

William Casarin mentioned **primal** first, so that is what I tried.

I searched for **primal** on the //play store//:

I installed and ran it (**primal**), and was greeted with this screen:

I didn't have a **nostr** account yet, so I tapped the “//Create Account//” button.
That took me to this screen:

The **primal** nostr app prompted me to //add a photo//, write in my //display name//, and write a bit //about myself//.
So I did:

After tapping the “//Next//” button, it then took me to this screen:

Here I was was asked to pick some //interests//.

What I later realized is that, the **primal** nostr app used this informtion (the //interests// I picked) to auto-follow some people on **nostr**.
That way I wouldn't have an empty home-food.

I picked some //interests//, tapped the  “//Next//” button, and was then taken to this screen:

Here, I was given a chance to change the //banner image// for my **nostr** account.
I did so:

And then tapped the “//Create Account Now//” button, and was then taken to this screen:

At this point, I had joined **nostr**.
But there was another (optional) part of **primal**'s //on-boarding//.

Here **primal** was giving me the option to //activate a wallet// or to //skip// it.

I tapped the “//Acitivate Wallet//” button to see what was there, and was then taken to this screen:

It wanted a bunch of personal information from me —
my first-name, my family-name, my e-mail address, my date-of-birth, and my country of residence.
(I realized later that this was all optional — and I didn't have to give this information to use **primal** or **nostr**.)

That is a lot of information — too much information — to ask for when signing up for a social-media network!

My suspicion is that they want to do a KYC look up — probably for the wallet.

I said to William Casarin:

― I just installed the primal nostr app on my android phone.
― 
― It wants me to "Activate My Wallet".
― 
― It wants my name, e-mail address, date of birth, and country of residence.

William Casarin then said:

― yeah they use a kyc wallet (strike)

I then asked William Casarin:

― Do I need to activate that wallet to use nostr?

William Casarin replied with:

― nope, nostr has nothing to do with bitcoin

Great.
I didn't want to give them (or anyone else) all that information.
So, I //skipped it// by pressing the “//I'll do this later//” link.
(I will very likely //not// be //doing that later//, BTW.)

At that point I was out of the //on-boarding// part of the **primal** app, and seeing the home-feed of the **primal** nostr app:

What I thought was funny is that William Casarin was already in my **nostr** home-feed 🙂

This is when I suspected that the **primal** nostr app had auto-followed a bunch of people (including William Casarin) because of the //interests// I chose during the on-boarding.
And looking at who I was following on **nostr**, that suspicion turned out to be correct:

I wrote my first **nostr** post:

And then, William Casarin followed me:

And tagged me in a public post:

Which seemed to cause a number of people to engage with me.
William Casarin has a lot of followers on nostr.

I also went ahead and //edited my profile// — adding a //username//, //display name//, //website//, and //about me// information:

After that I looked to see if some (other) people I know were on **nostr**, so I could follow them.
I found some.

§§ First Thoughts

**nostr** feels like a micro-blogging platform — similar to Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky, Farcaster, Misskey, Firefish, Sharkey, Pleroma, Akkoma, and many others.

Although unlike Twitter, which is centralized, **nostr** is a **decentralized** social-media networking platform — similar (in many ways) to the Fediverse (which includes Mastodon, Misskey, Firefish, Sharkey, Pleroma, Akkoma, and many others), Bluesky, Farcaster, and others.

**nostr** has nothing to do with Bitcoin or the (Bitcoin L2) Lightning Network.
But there are a lot of Bitcoin and Lightning Network enthusiasts on **nostr**.
I suspect that over time, as **nostr** attracts more and more people, that the type of people on **nostr** will become more varied.

My experience with **nostr** is, so far, via the **primal** nostr app.

(When William Casarin releases an //android version// of his damus app, I will try that, too.)

So far I have had a good experience on **nostr**.
